## Super IdeaBox

At the heart of every app is an IdeaBox (and a Tinder). IdeaBox was one of the first pure Rails apps we learned during our time at Turing, and it helped solidify the proper foundation for things to come.

This version uses jQuery and AJAX the CRUD system instead of traditional REST-ful services.

### Features to come:

- Hopefully better views that allow us to continue playing around with CSS within the Skeleton grid system.
